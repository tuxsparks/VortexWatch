                <p>In a shocking turn of events for the storm chasing community, the iconic Tornado Intercept Vehicle 2 (TIV 2) was sold at a private auction on October 21, 2019 for a whopping $30,000. The vehicle, once the star of IMAX documentaries, had been sitting in disrepair for several years.</p>
                <p>The buyer, Ryan Shepard, mechanical engineer, has pledged to fully restore the 14,000-pound beast. Plans include upgrading the hydraulic skirting system and replacing the aging armor plating with modern carbon-steel composites.</p>

                <p>Dominator 3 got its front rebuilt with new train lights and reinforced steel, I guess that means no more deer strikes. However, there is an issue with it because sense theres no lineX, it gets rusty, as you can see in the photo.</p>
