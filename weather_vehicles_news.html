            <h2>TIV 2 Purchased for $30,000: The Resurrection of a Legend</h2>
            <p>In a shocking turn of events for the storm chasing community, the iconic Tornado Intercept Vehicle 2 (TIV 2) was sold at a private auction on October 21, 2019 for a whopping $30,000. The vehicle, once the star of IMAX documentaries, had been sitting in disrepair for several years.</p>
            <p>The buyer, Ryan Shepard mechanical engineer, has pledged to fully restore the 14,000-pound beast. Plans include upgrading the hydraulic skirting system and replacing the aging armor plating with modern carbon-steel composites.</p>
