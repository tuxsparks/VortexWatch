            <h2>TIV 2 Purchased for $5,000: The Resurrection of a Legend</h2>
            <p>In a shocking turn of events for the storm chasing community, the iconic Tornado Intercept Vehicle 2 (TIV 2) was sold at a private auction yesterday for a mere $5,000. The vehicle, once the star of IMAX documentaries, had been sitting in disrepair for several years.</p>
            <p>The buyer, a private weather enthusiast and mechanical engineer, has pledged to fully restore the 14,000-pound beast. Plans include upgrading the hydraulic skirting system and replacing the aging armor plating with modern carbon-steel composites.</p>

            <h2>Record-Breaking Velocity: The 2.7-Mile Wide Monster</h2>
            <p>Meteorologists are still analyzing data from last night's historic event. Preliminary radar surveys indicate the tornado reached a maximum width of 2.7 miles, making it one of the largest ever recorded by mobile Doppler units.</p>
            <p>Beyond its size, the "vortex-within-a-vortex" structure observed by field teams suggests internal wind speeds exceeding 300 mph. Scientists believe a unique combination of high atmospheric instability and extreme low-level shear created the "perfect setup" for this anomaly.</p>
            <p>Emergency management teams are currently on the ground. Despite the scale of the storm, early warning systems provided a 25-minute lead time, significantly reducing the potential for casualties.</p>

            <h2>Next-Gen Satellite "Aegis-7" Successfully Deployed</h2>
            <p>NASA and NOAA have confirmed that the Aegis-7 weather satellite has reached its geostationary orbit. This new hardware provides 30-second refresh rates on lightning detection and cloud-top cooling trends.</p>
            <p>This deployment marks a new era in hyper-local forecasting, allowing meteorologists to predict "tornadogenesis" with much higher accuracy than the previous GOES series satellites.</p>
